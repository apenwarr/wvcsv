 * by simply concatenating them with commas in between.
 * 
 * We only add actual quotation marks if leaving them out would make parsing
 * ambiguous.
 * 
 * It *is* valid for s to contain newline characters.  This will produce an
 * output CSV line that contains newlines, but parsing is not ambiguous because
 * the newlines will be inside quotes.
 * 
 * Note: for NULL pointers we produce an empty string ("").  For empty strings,
 * we produce the empty quoted string ("\"\"").  This arbitrary rule can be
 * used to differentiate between the two cases upon decoding, but a decoder
 * that doesn't know this rule can simply treat them both as empty strings.
